# EPIC-005: Claude Code Agent Backlog Enhancement

## Executive Summary
Transform Claude Code's existing agents into backlog-aware assistants that automatically manage, update, and report on backlog items during the natural flow of development work.

## Vision Statement
"Every line of code tells a story - literally. Claude Code agents will understand and maintain the connection between code and backlog items, eliminating the overhead of manual tracking while improving visibility and traceability."

## Business Case

### Current Pain Points
- **Manual Overhead**: Developers spend 30-45 min/day updating backlog items
- **Synchronization Drift**: Code and backlog often out of sync
- **Missing Traceability**: Hard to link code changes to requirements
- **Context Switching**: Constant jumps between IDE and backlog tools
- **Forgotten Updates**: Stories remain "in progress" after completion

### Expected Benefits
- **Time Savings**: 3-4 hours/week per developer
- **Accuracy**: 95% automatic correct status updates
- **Traceability**: 100% code-to-requirement linking
- **Flow State**: Developers stay in IDE/terminal
- **Real-time Insights**: Always current sprint status

### ROI Calculation
- Team size: 5 developers
- Time saved: 4 hours/week/developer = 20 hours/week
- Cost: 55 story points ≈ 220 hours implementation
- Payback period: 11 weeks
- Annual savings: 1,040 hours

## Scope Definition

### Enhanced Agents

#### Tier 1: Core Agents (Must Have)
1. **doc-standards-guardian**
   - Validates backlog references in documentation
   - Synchronizes README with sprint status
   - Updates CHANGELOG from completed stories
   - Maintains traceability matrix

2. **business-analyst-justice**
   - Generates requirements from discussions
   - Creates properly formatted epics
   - Decomposes epics into stories
   - Adds compliance metadata

3. **quality-assurance-tester**
   - Links tests to stories
   - Reports coverage per requirement
   - Creates bugs from failures
   - Validates acceptance criteria

#### Tier 2: Workflow Agents (Should Have)
4. **workflow-router**
   - Routes work based on backlog item type
   - Updates status during workflow
   - Escalates blocked items
   - Triggers status automations

5. **developer-implementer**
   - Reads acceptance criteria
   - Adds story IDs to commits
   - Updates actual hours
   - Marks stories for review

6. **code-reviewer-comprehensive**
   - Validates against acceptance criteria
   - Checks Definition of Done
   - Links comments to stories
   - Calculates epic progress

#### Tier 3: Advanced Agents (Could Have)
7. **sprint-coordinator** (NEW)
   - Manages sprint ceremonies
   - Generates standup reports
   - Calculates burndown
   - Identifies risks

8. **backlog-analyst** (NEW)
   - Suggests story splits
   - Detects scope creep
   - Predicts velocity
   - Recommends prioritization

### Core Capabilities

#### Automatic Detection
- Story IDs in code comments
- TODOs → backlog items
- Bug patterns → bug reports
- Test coverage → story completion

#### Intelligent Updates
- Git activity → status changes
- PR creation → review status
- Test results → acceptance validation
- Time tracking → actual hours

#### Proactive Assistance
- "Story too large" warnings
- "Missing tests" alerts
- "Update blocked story?" prompts
- "Create bug report?" suggestions

```

### Data Flow
1. Developer triggers agent command
2. Agent reads backlog context
3. Agent performs requested action
4. Agent updates backlog items
5. Changes sync to dashboard
6. Notifications sent if needed

### Configuration
```yaml
# .claude-backlog.yml
agents:
  doc-standards-guardian:
    backlog_aware: true
    auto_update: true
    validations:
      - story_references
      - changelog_sync
      - traceability
